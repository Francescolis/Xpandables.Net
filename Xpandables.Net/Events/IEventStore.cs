namespace Xpandables.Net.Events;

// Plan (pseudocode):
// - Core stream operations:
//   - AppendAsync(streamId, events, expectedVersion?, ct): append events with optimistic concurrency.
//   - ReadStreamAsync(streamId, fromVersion, ct): read forward from a stream.
//   - ReadAllAsync(fromPosition?, ct): read forward across all streams (if supported by store).
//   - GetStreamVersionAsync(streamId, ct): latest version of a stream.
//   - StreamExistsAsync(streamId, ct): does a stream exist.
// - Maintenance:
//   - DeleteStreamAsync(streamId, hardDelete, ct): soft/hard delete a stream.
//   - TruncateStreamAsync(streamId, toVersionInclusive, ct): remove older events up to a version.
// - Subscriptions (push-based):
//   - SubscribeToStream(streamId, fromVersion?, onEvent, ct) -> IAsyncDisposable: live stream subscription.
//   - SubscribeToAll(fromPosition?, onEvent, ct) -> IAsyncDisposable: live "all" subscription.
// - Notes:
//   - Use IAsyncEnumerable<object> for reads to support streaming.
//   - Use ValueTask in callbacks to minimize allocations.
//   - Use CancellationToken in all async operations.

/// event streams in an asynchronous and scalable manner.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>The event store interface provides core operations for working with event streams, including
/// optimistic concurrency control, streaming reads, and live event subscriptions. All operations are asynchronous and
/// support cancellation via a cancellation token. Implementations may support both per-stream and global (all-streams)
/// operations, as well as push-based subscriptions for real-time event processing. Thread safety and scalability
/// considerations depend on the specific implementation.</remarks>
